    "# In-Class 8+9: Special Relativity\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we're going to get our first look at the the physical consequences of Special Relativity. In class, you learned about length contraction and time dilation. We're going to explore the distortions these effects create in perception of the world around us, and the physical, measurable impact they have on the earth's surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Special Relativity tells us that two observers moving very quickly with respect to one another will experience time and space differently. We often use the word _boost_ to refer to velocity difference between two frames. Observers that are boosted with respect to some other object will experience _length contraction_. The apparent length of an object depends on the size of the boost, defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L = \\frac{L_0}{\\gamma} $$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $L$ is the observed distance between two points on an object, while $L_0$ is the distance between those points in the rest frame of the object. $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} $$.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this equation, it should be clear that $\\gamma$ is approximately 1 when speeds are much smaller than the speed of light, and gets larger and larger (approaching infinity) as speeds get closer to the speed of light. As far as we know, it's not possible for an observer to exceed the speed of light (with some interesting exceptions in the inflationary period of expansion we think occurred after the big bang - but that's a topic for another time!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, _length is only contracted in the direction of boost_. If you are flying above the surface of the Earth at relativistic speeds, the earth will appear to contract in the direction you're flying in, but if you look left or right, distances along that axis will be preserved. \n",
    "\n",
    "Clocks also behave differently with different boost. Observers that are boosted with respect to one another will also experience _time dilation_. Two events will seem further apart to an observer if they're occuring in a frame boosted with respect to them. To that observer, time will appear as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta t = \\gamma\\Delta t_0 $$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\Delta t_0$ represents the time interval between two instances in the rest frame of those events, while $\\Delta t$ gives the apparent time interval to the observer moving at velocity $v$. This means, for example, that if you were to fly away from the earth at relativistics speeds, to someone on earth, you would appear to be aging more slowly than them. (The interpretation of this can be tricky and leads to something called the twin paradox -- check it out if you're curious!)\n",
    "\n",
    "_To summarize, as you move past an object, its length (in the direction of your boost) will appear to shrink, and its clock will appear to move more slowly._\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we'll work with simulating the impact of these two effects. "
